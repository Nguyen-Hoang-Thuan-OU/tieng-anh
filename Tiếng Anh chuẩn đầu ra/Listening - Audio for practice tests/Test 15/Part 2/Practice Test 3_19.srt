<font color="#f3f3f3">Miss Hooper art teacher</font>

10
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:38,144
<font color="#fdfdfd">Yeah here's what happened</font>

11
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:44,544
<font color="#e1e1e1">When I pulled out of the school parking lot I guess I pressed down on the accelerator too hard so the tire</font>

12
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,592
<font color="#cdcdcd">Tires squeal pretty loudly</font>

13
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:49,408
<font color="#fcfcfc">I'm surprised you didn't hear it from your classroom</font>

14
00:00:49,664 --> 00:00:52,992
<font color="#fcfcfc">Oh so that's what that noise was</font>

15
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:55,552
<font color="#ededed">Okay nevermind</font>

16
00:00:57,088 --> 00:01:03,232
<font color="#e7e7e7">Anyway as I left the school I happen to pull out in front of a car that was going really fast</font>

17
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:04,768
<font color="#fdfdfd">So it almost hit us</font>

18
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:08,864
<font color="#fbfbfb">Fortunately the driver managed to stop at the last moment</font>

19
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,912
<font color="#fcfcfc">I was pretty shaken up by that</font>

20
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:14,752
<font color="#f4f4f4">So I didn't notice that the first stoplight we came to was red</font>

21
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:17,824
<font color="#fcfcfc">I drove right through it without even stopping</font>

22
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,640
<font color="#dbdbdb">I can't believe I broke the law like that</font>

23
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:24,224
<font color="#f6f6f6">You didn't I did</font>

24
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:29,600
<font color="#f6f6f6">I guess Miss Hooper had had enough by then since you told me to pull over and mediately</font>

25
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:31,904
<font color="#fcfcfc">She made me sit in the passenger seat</font>

26
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,952
<font color="#b2b2b2">Was he drove back to school</font>

27
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:38,048
<font color="#fcfcfc">She berated me about my driving skills the entire trip back</font>

28
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:43,424
<font color="#f1f1f1">I guess that you're not going to be driving in class again for a long time</font>

29
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,472
<font color="#fdfdfd">That's what Miss Hooper said</font>

30
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,568
<font color="#fcfcfc">Now answer the questions</font>

31
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:54,944
<font color="#f4f4f4">Number 19 what is the girl mean when she says this</font>
