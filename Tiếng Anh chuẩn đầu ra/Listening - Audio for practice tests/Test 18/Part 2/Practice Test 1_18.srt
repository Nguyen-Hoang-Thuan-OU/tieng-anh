00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:05,632
<font color="#fcfcfc">Listen to a conversation between a student and a teacher</font>

3
00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:12,032
<font color="#a2a2a2">Mr. Pressler Tommy just told me that you wanted to speak with me about something</font>

4
00:00:12,544 --> 00:00:14,848
<font color="#fcfcfc">He wasn't pulling my leg was he</font>

5
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:20,224
<font color="#dbdbdb">No he wasn't I know Tommy is something of a joker but he was telling you the truth</font>

6
00:00:20,736 --> 00:00:23,040
<font color="#fcfcfc">I did ask him to find you for me</font>

7
00:00:23,296 --> 00:00:25,856
<font color="#fcfcfc">Well here I am</font>

8
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:28,416
<font color="#fcfcfc">Indeed</font>

9
00:00:28,672 --> 00:00:34,816
<font color="#fcfcfc">Anyway it's about your science project you were supposed to submit the status report on it to me yesterday but</font>

10
00:00:35,072 --> 00:00:35,840
<font color="#f2f2f2">You never did that</font>

11
00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:37,120
<font color="#fcfcfc">What's going on</font>

12
00:00:37,376 --> 00:00:43,520
<font color="#a3a3a3">Oh its status report I totally forgot to email it to you I've been so busy</font>

13
00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:47,104
<font color="#fcfcfc">Busy with classes and other things that it slipped my mind</font>

14
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,408
<font color="#e6e6e6">That's alright I understand</font>

15
00:00:49,664 --> 00:00:55,808
<font color="#fcfcfc">Well since you're here why don't you just give me the status report now if I remember</font>

16
00:00:56,064 --> 00:01:01,184
<font color="#f2f2f2">Correctly you were doing some sort of chemistry experiment in your father's laboratory at work right</font>

17
00:01:01,696 --> 00:01:02,720
<font color="#fcfcfc">That's right</font>

18
00:01:03,232 --> 00:01:04,256
<font color="#fcfcfc">How's it going</font>

19
00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:09,376
<font color="#eaeaea">The lab work is pretty much all finished I got some interesting results</font>

20
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:13,984
<font color="#f6f6f6">They weren't quite the results that I had predicted but they're still unique</font>

21
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:19,104
<font color="#f8f8f8">Okay and how about the report you're going to write how's the progress on it going</font>

22
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:24,480
<font color="#fcfcfc">Actually I haven't even started on it yet</font>

23
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:30,880
<font color="#eeeeee">I know there are only two more weeks until it's due so I'm going to get to work on it tomorrow</font>

24
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:32,416
<font color="#e3e3e3">Is that alright</font>

25
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:34,976
<font color="#f8f8f8">I suppose that's fine for now</font>

26
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:40,864
<font color="#fcfcfc">But be sure to send me a status report next Monday I need to know how you're doing with that report</font>

27
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,424
<font color="#fcfcfc">Sure I can handle that</font>

28
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:47,264
<font color="#fcfcfc">Now answer the questions</font>

29
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:49,312
<font color="#f8f8f8">Number 18</font>

30
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:51,872
<font color="#fcfcfc">What is the main topic of the conversation</font>
