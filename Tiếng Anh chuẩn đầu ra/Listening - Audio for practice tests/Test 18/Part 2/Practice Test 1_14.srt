<font color="#fcfcfc">Questions 14 through 17</font>

2
00:00:02,304 --> 00:00:05,632
<font color="#fcfcfc">Listen to a conversation between a student and a teacher</font>

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:10,240
<font color="#d9d9d9">Jeff you said that you wanted to talk to me about something</font>

4
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:12,544
<font color="#fcfcfc">Do you have a moment to chat right now</font>

5
00:00:13,056 --> 00:00:16,640
<font color="#f6f6f6">Yes ma'am I think I've got a few moments before my next class</font>

6
00:00:17,152 --> 00:00:22,272
<font color="#f8f8f8">Great so what's going on is everything okay in class</font>

7
00:00:22,528 --> 00:00:27,136
<font color="#f9f9f9">Class is going great I think I understand most of the material we are learning</font>

8
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:31,488
<font color="#eaeaea">But that I have a question about our upcoming lab assignment</font>

9
00:00:31,744 --> 00:00:35,840
<font color="#dddddd">You're talking about the one where we dissect some animals right</font>

10
00:00:36,352 --> 00:00:38,144
<font color="#fcfcfc">Yes that's the one</font>

11
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:44,544
<font color="#dddddd">You see I'm a little squeamish and I'm not quite sure how I'm going to react to Cuttin Up Anna</font>

12
00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:47,616
<font color="#fcfcfc">Do I have to do this assignment</font>

13
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:54,272
<font color="#fcfcfc">First of all I wouldn't worry too much after all it's not like we're going to be dissecting</font>

14
00:00:54,528 --> 00:00:57,600
<font color="#fcfcfc">Dogs cats or any other cute animals</font>

15
00:00:57,856 --> 00:01:02,464
<font color="#e5e5e5">For our first lab assignment we're simply going to cut up a few worms</font>

16
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,512
<font color="#b0b0b0">Wareham's that's it</font>

17
00:01:04,768 --> 00:01:08,352
<font color="#efefef">That's it you don't have a problem with worms do you</font>

18
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:13,984
<font color="#f1f1f1">No not at all in fact I use worms as bait everytime I go fishing</font>

19
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:17,568
<font color="#fcfcfc">I don't think I'll have any problems with the lab in that case</font>

20
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:21,152
<font color="#fbfbfb">That's great to hear but do me a favor</font>

21
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:27,552
<font color="#fafafa">If you have a problem dissecting something else in the future just tell me I can excuse you if</font>

22
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:29,600
<font color="#fcfcfc">If you really think you can't do it</font>

23
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:35,232
<font color="#ebebeb">About two or three students each year so it's not a big deal</font>

24
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:38,560
<font color="#fcfcfc">That's good to know thanks for telling me that</font>

25
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:42,144
<font color="#cacaca">Now answer the questions</font>

26
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:44,448
<font color="#f5f5f5">Number 14</font>

27
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:47,264
<font color="#fcfcfc">What is the main topic of the conversation</font>
