00:00:26,112 --> 00:00:27,904
<font color="#fcfcfc">Please have a seat in this chair</font>

9
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:33,280
<font color="#fcfcfc">As the principal of this school I'd like to be the first person to welcome you here</font>

10
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:38,144
<font color="#fafafa">Thank you sir I'm very glad to be a new student at Briarwood</font>

11
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,936
<font color="#fcfcfc">I'm happy to hear that</font>

12
00:00:40,192 --> 00:00:44,032
<font color="#a1a1a1">Milk before you attend your first class do you have any questions for me</font>

13
00:00:44,288 --> 00:00:50,432
<font color="#fbfbfb">Not right now sir I'm sure I'll have some questions later but</font>

14
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:54,784
<font color="#fcfcfc">I guess I don't really know what to ask at the moment</font>

15
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,064
<font color="#9a9a9a">Alright</font>

16
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,672
<font color="#fafafa">In that case let me tell you a little bit about what we expect from you at this school</font>

17
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:01,952
<font color="#fcfcfc">Sure</font>

18
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:08,352
<font color="#fcfcfc">First of all here at Briarwood we take the honor code very seriously so there is to be no cheating</font>

19
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:13,728
<font color="#f4f4f4">That means no cheating on homework test presentations or other assignments</font>

20
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,800
<font color="#f1f1f1">In addition we frown upon lying here</font>

21
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:18,336
<font color="#fcfcfc">I understand</font>

22
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:22,432
<font color="#c0c0c0">Good student who cheat or lie are severely punished</font>

23
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:24,736
<font color="#fcfcfc">Do it twice and we will kick you out</font>

24
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:29,600
<font color="#ebebeb">But you seem like a nice young lady so I'm sure we won't have any problems like that with you</font>

25
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:33,184
<font color="#fcfcfc">I hope not sir is there anything else</font>

26
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:36,768
<font color="#f2f2f2">Yes there's one more thing before you go to class</font>

27
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,376
<font color="#fcfcfc">Please understand that you can talk to me anytime you have questions or problems</font>

28
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:45,728
<font color="#f6f6f6">I know it's not easy being a transfer student in the middle of the semester</font>

29
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:48,288
<font color="#dddddd">It might take you a while to adjust here</font>

30
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:50,336
<font color="#fcfcfc">But I want to see you succeed</font>

31
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:53,920
<font color="#fcfcfc">So please come to my office if there is anything bothering you</font>

32
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:59,040
<font color="#fcfcfc">Okay if I have any problems I'll be sure to talk to you about them</font>

33
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:02,624
<font color="#fcfcfc">Now answer the questions</font>

34
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:04,416
<font color="#f6f6f6">Number 10</font>

35
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:06,464
