<font color="#e5e5e5">Questions 3333</font>

2
00:00:02,816 --> 00:00:05,888
<font color="#eeeeee">Listen to a teacher talking in a history class</font>

3
00:00:07,168 --> 00:00:11,264
<font color="#ebebeb">Two of the oldest civilizations in human history our Egypt</font>

4
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:12,800
<font color="#fcfcfc">And Mesopotamia</font>

5
00:00:13,312 --> 00:00:17,152
<font color="#f6f6f6">We talked about both of them during the past two days right</font>

6
00:00:17,408 --> 00:00:19,200
<font color="#f9f9f9">As I hope you all remember</font>

7
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:21,760
<font color="#f4f4f4">They were fairly different societies</font>

8
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:26,112
<font color="#fcfcfc">But I want to talk today about how they had some similarities</font>

9
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:29,696
<font color="#ededed">For one rather large structures</font>

10
00:00:29,952 --> 00:00:30,464
<font color="#cdcdcd">No</font>

11
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,304
<font color="#f4f4f4">When I mention Egypt what do you usually think about</font>

12
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,864
<font color="#fcfcfc">Yeah that's right pyramids</font>

13
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,192
<font color="#fcfcfc">The Egyptians build pyramids all over the place</font>

14
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:42,496
<font color="#fcfcfc">Many of them are still standing</font>

15
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:43,520
<font color="#fcfcfc">Okay</font>

16
00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:46,080
<font color="#fcfcfc">But when I mention Mesopotamia</font>

17
00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:48,640
<font color="#fcfcfc">What kinds of buildings do you think about</font>

18
00:00:48,896 --> 00:00:49,920
<font color="#f4f4f4">No one</font>

19
00:00:50,944 --> 00:00:52,736
<font color="#fcfcfc">Yeah that's what I thought</font>

20
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,064
<font color="#e4e4e4">Well the Mesopotamians build cigarettes</font>

21
00:00:56,576 --> 00:01:01,184
<font color="#fcfcfc">That's ziggurats</font>

22
00:01:01,696 --> 00:01:05,280
<font color="#f8f8f8">There's a picture of them on page 218 in your books</font>

23
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:06,560
<font color="#fcfcfc">Take a look</font>

24
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:10,912
<font color="#fcfcfc">Here's a picture of a pyramid as you can see</font>

25
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:15,008
<font color="#dddddd">The main differences between the two are there shapes and sizes</font>

26
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:19,360
<font color="#f3f3f3">Notice that the Egyptian pyramid is more triangular in shape</font>

27
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:24,480
<font color="#ededed">Also the pyramid is smooth-sided and its sides are rather steep</font>

28
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:27,296
<font color="#eeeeee">But look at the ziggurat here</font>

29
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:30,624
<font color="#f6f6f6">You can see that it has a step appearance</font>

30
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:33,184
<font color="#7e7e7e">By step</font>

31
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:37,792
<font color="#fcfcfc">I mean that the ziggurat look like it has different levels doesn't it</font>

32
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:43,424
<font color="#fcfcfc">It looks sort of like a lot of different size boxes stacked on top of one another</font>

33
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:49,056
<font color="#efefef">The biggest box is on the bottom and the boxes get smaller as you go higher</font>

34
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:54,432
<font color="#d6d6d6">Oh and noticed that the ziggurat has a set of stairs leading to the tub</font>

35
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:56,480
<font color="#dbdbdb">The pyramid Laxus</font>

36
00:01:56,736 --> 00:01:59,040
<font color="#fcfcfc">Why did cigarettes have stairs</font>

37
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:01,344
<font color="#fcfcfc">Each had a temple at the top</font>

38
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,440
<font color="#fcfcfc">So the Mesopotamians climb the stairs to reach the temple</font>

39
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:08,512
<font color="#fcfcfc">This brings me to another key difference</font>

40
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,328
<font color="#d9d9d9">Ziggurats were places of worship</font>

41
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:15,936
<font color="#f2f2f2">They were used by priests to pray to the various Mesopotamian gods</font>

42
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:19,008
<font color="#fcfcfc">But the pyramids were tunes for the Pharaohs</font>

43
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:22,592
<font color="#fcfcfc">They were the kings of ancient Egypt</font>

44
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:26,432
<font color="#cccccc">Many pharaohs built pyramids to be their tombs when they died</font>

45
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:30,016
<font color="#f8f8f8">The largest one took nearly 20 years to build</font>

46
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:34,880
<font color="#cacaca">How did the Egyptians and Mesopotamians build these huge structures</font>

47
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:36,928
<font color="#fcfcfc">That's a good question</font>

48
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:38,464
<font color="#fcfcfc">No one is sure</font>

49
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,512
<font color="#fcfcfc">But people have some theories</font>

50
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:43,840
<font color="#fcfcfc">Let me tell you about a few of them right now</font>

51
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:47,680
<font color="#fcfcfc">Now answer the questions</font>

52
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:49,728
<font color="#fcfcfc">Number 30</font>

53
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,288
<font color="#f8f8f8">What is the main idea of the talk</font>
