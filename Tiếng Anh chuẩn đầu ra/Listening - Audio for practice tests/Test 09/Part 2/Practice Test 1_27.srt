<font color="#f1f1f1">Questions 27 through 29</font>

2
00:00:02,816 --> 00:00:06,144
<font color="#f8f8f8">Listen to a teacher talking in a biology class</font>

3
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:13,568
<font color="#eaeaea">All the species of squirrels that exist probably the most interesting one is the flying squirrel</font>

4
00:00:14,336 --> 00:00:20,480
<font color="#d6d6d6">It doesn't really fly though after all this girl doesn't have wings and it can't take off from</font>

5
00:00:20,736 --> 00:00:21,504
<font color="#fcfcfc">The ground either</font>

6
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,064
<font color="#fcfcfc">Instead of flying it Glides</font>

7
00:00:24,576 --> 00:00:26,368
<font color="#fcfcfc">How is it able to do that</font>

8
00:00:27,136 --> 00:00:32,000
<font color="#d0d0d0">It's body has a special membrane that stretches between its legs and feed</font>

9
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:38,400
<font color="#ebebeb">This membrane is found on both sides of its body it's made of skin and fur and is very</font>

10
00:00:38,656 --> 00:00:39,424
<font color="#fcfcfc">Flexible</font>

11
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:43,520
<font color="#fcfcfc">Normally the membrane is tucked along the sides of its body</font>

12
00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:47,616
<font color="#fcfcfc">Take a look at the picture on page 156 in your books</font>

13
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:48,640
<font color="#e6e6e6">See it</font>

14
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:53,504
<font color="#d2d2d2">That Ridge like fold of fur along its side is the membrane</font>

15
00:00:54,016 --> 00:00:57,600
<font color="#fcfcfc">What does the squirrel do with that membrane</font>

16
00:00:57,856 --> 00:00:58,880
<font color="#fcfcfc">Let me tell you</font>

17
00:00:59,136 --> 00:00:59,648
<font color="#e3e3e3">First</font>

18
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:05,280
<font color="#e7e7e7">In order to take to the air the Flying Squirrel needs to be high above the ground</font>

19
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:08,096
<font color="#f5f5f5">It typically jumps from tall trees</font>

20
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:11,680
<font color="#fcfcfc">When it leaps into the air it stretches its legs</font>

21
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:16,032
<font color="#f2f2f2">This causes the membrane to unfold and to become taught</font>

22
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:18,592
<font color="#f8f8f8">I guess it's sort of like</font>

23
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:21,152
<font color="#eeeeee">Like a parachute at that point</font>

24
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:25,504
<font color="#e2e2e2">This membrane catches the air and allows the squirrel to Glide</font>

25
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,040
<font color="#fcfcfc">In some cases</font>

26
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:32,672
<font color="#f5f5f5">It can even act like a wing and enable the squirrel to gain a small amount of altitude</font>

27
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:33,696
<font color="#f5f5f5">Yes Gina</font>

28
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:37,280
<font color="#fcfcfc">How far can one of these squirrels Glide</font>

29
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:44,960
<font color="#e8e8e8">In general they make relatively short Glides of around 5 2:30 however</font>

30
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:50,080
<font color="#cfcfcf">The longest Glide ever observed by a person was nearly 90 m</font>

31
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:52,384
<font color="#dedede">Why don't we take a look at a video</font>

32
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,200
<font color="#fafafa">And then you can see the flying squirrel in action</font>

33
00:01:57,248 --> 00:01:59,296
<font color="#fcfcfc">Now answer the questions</font>

34
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:04,416
<font color="#f5f5f5">Number 27 what is the teacher mainly talking about</font>
