2
00:00:02,816 --> 00:00:06,144
<font color="#f7f7f7">Listen to a teacher talking in a biology class</font>

3
00:00:07,168 --> 00:00:10,752
<font color="#f9f9f9">One of the most beautiful creatures in the forest is the deer</font>

4
00:00:11,008 --> 00:00:16,384
<font color="#fcfcfc">It lives pretty much everywhere in the world except for Australia and Antarctica</font>

5
00:00:16,896 --> 00:00:18,432
<font color="#fcfcfc">There are many species of deer</font>

6
00:00:18,944 --> 00:00:22,528
<font color="#ececec">However the one I want to talk about is the white-tailed deer</font>

7
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,344
<font color="#fcfcfc">It mostly lives in North America</font>

8
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,672
<font color="#fcfcfc">I'm sure that many of you have seen this deer before</font>

9
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:33,792
<font color="#fcfcfc">I actually saw a couple of them near the road as I drove to school this morning</font>

10
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:40,192
<font color="#fcfcfc">Anyway the first thing I should mention is that we have different names for male and female deer</font>

11
00:00:40,704 --> 00:00:43,008
<font color="#d4d4d4">The mail is usually called a buck</font>

12
00:00:43,264 --> 00:00:46,336
<font color="#fcfcfc">Some people call it a stag or a heart though</font>

13
00:00:46,592 --> 00:00:50,432
<font color="#dbdbdb">That's Hart not heart</font>

14
00:00:50,944 --> 00:00:54,272
<font color="#e9e9e9">The female deer on the other hand is called a do</font>

15
00:00:54,528 --> 00:00:56,576
<font color="#fafafa">And a baby deer is a fawn</font>

16
00:00:57,344 --> 00:01:00,672
<font color="#f0f0f0">There are several differences between Stags and doze</font>

17
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:02,720
<font color="#c4c4c4">A stag is bigger than a do</font>

18
00:01:03,232 --> 00:01:06,560
<font color="#a2a2a2">A stag weighs 100 kg on average</font>

19
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:10,400
<font color="#fcfcfc">However some of them can grow to be much larger than that</font>

20
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:15,264
<font color="#d0d0d0">As for females they averaged around 70 kg in weight</font>

21
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:19,104
<font color="#fcfcfc">Another big difference between the two is antlers</font>

22
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:24,480
<font color="#ebebeb">Antlers are the long sharp pointed bony protrusions on a deer's head</font>

23
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:27,808
<font color="#c0c0c0">They begin as Too Short stubby knobs</font>

24
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:32,672
<font color="#cacaca">As they grow they can form several branches that have many points</font>

25
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:34,976
<font color="#f5f5f5">But only Stags have antlers</font>

26
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:37,280
<font color="#e9e9e9">Those don't have them</font>

27
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:40,096
<font color="#fcfcfc">Oh here's something you might not know</font>

28
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:42,400
<font color="#fcfcfc">Antlers fall off every year</font>

29
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:48,288
<font color="#cccccc">Stags lose their antlers during the winter and then new ones grow during the Spring and Summer</font>

30
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:53,664
<font color="#ececec">Deer are mammals so that means the mothers give birth to live animals</font>

31
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,760
<font color="#dadada">I do has between one and three fawns when it gives birth</font>

32
00:01:58,272 --> 00:02:00,832
<font color="#cbcbcb">The Fawns have white spots when they're born</font>

33
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:04,928
<font color="#eaeaea">For the first six weeks of their lives they drink their mother's milk</font>

34
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:09,536
<font color="#f9f9f9">Remember that's another characteristic of mammals</font>

35
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:12,608
<font color="#bbbbbb">Bonds don't exclusively drink milk</font>

36
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:15,424
<font color="#fafafa">They can walk pretty much as soon as they're born</font>

37
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,264
<font color="#fcfcfc">So they can forage for grass and other food right away</font>

38
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:23,104
<font color="#fcfcfc">Now answer the questions</font>

39
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:25,408
<font color="#fcfcfc">Number 34</font>

40
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,224
<font color="#fcfcfc">What is the teacher mainly talking about</font>
