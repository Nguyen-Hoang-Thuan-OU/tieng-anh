00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:02,816
<font color="#dedede">Now you will hear longer talk or conversations</font>

2
00:00:03,328 --> 00:00:06,912
<font color="#fcfcfc">East awkward conversation will be followed by three or more questions</font>

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:13,056
<font color="#eaeaea">Choose the best answer to each question then Mark the letter of the correct answer on your answer sheet</font>

4
00:00:13,824 --> 00:00:16,640
<font color="#d3d3d3">You will hear each talk or conversation only one time</font>

5
00:00:17,664 --> 00:00:19,200
<font color="#fcfcfc">Questions 10 through 13</font>

6
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:22,272
<font color="#fcfcfc">Listen to a conversation between two students</font>

7
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,064
<font color="#e8e8e8">Hey Greg</font>

8
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,136
<font color="#fcfcfc">I see you just finished up soccer practice</font>

9
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:30,976
<font color="#fcfcfc">Volleyball practice ended for me only a few minutes ago</font>

10
00:00:31,488 --> 00:00:32,512
<font color="#fcfcfc">That's great</font>

11
00:00:32,768 --> 00:00:34,816
<font color="#fcfcfc">How is the team looking this year</font>

12
00:00:35,072 --> 00:00:37,120
<font color="#fcfcfc">Do you think you'll have a winning record</font>

13
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:40,448
<font color="#f9f9f9">Oh we definitely expect to do well</font>

14
00:00:40,704 --> 00:00:46,848
<font color="#f7f7f7">All of the starters from last year's Squad are returning and that team only lost three games all year</font>

15
00:00:47,616 --> 00:00:52,736
<font color="#e7e7e7">If you ask me I'd say we have a great shot at winning the state championship</font>

16
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:54,784
<font color="#fcfcfc">That's awesome news</font>

17
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:57,344
<font color="#fcfcfc">I hope the team meets expectations</font>

18
00:00:57,856 --> 00:01:00,928
<font color="#fcfcfc">So what about the soccer team</font>

19
00:01:01,184 --> 00:01:03,232
<font color="#fcfcfc">How do you guys expect to do</font>

20
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:05,536
<font color="#dadada">We are hoping to have a winning record</font>

21
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:06,816
<font color="#cecece">But</font>

22
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:10,400
<font color="#ededed">I don't know if I am going to be a part of the team this year</font>

23
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:11,680
<font color="#e6e6e6">Huh</font>

24
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:18,080
<font color="#fcfcfc">Tryouts are already over and you made the team coach Murphy isn't going to cut you now is he</font>

25
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:20,896
<font color="#bebebe">After all you are a starter</font>

26
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:22,432
<font color="#fcfcfc">No it's not that</font>

27
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:26,272
<font color="#fcfcfc">It's just that I'm having trouble keeping my grades up right now</font>

28
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:29,088
<font color="#dadada">I'm taking to advanced placement classes</font>

29
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:30,624
<font color="#eeeeee">In math and history</font>

30
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,928
<font color="#fcfcfc">And you know how much work they are</font>

31
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:36,768
<font color="#efefef">Since the team either practices or plays everyday</font>

32
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,584
<font color="#f5f5f5">I'm losing a lot of valuable study time</font>

33
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:45,984
<font color="#f8f8f8">You shouldn't quit though it's your senior year this is your last chance to be on the team</font>

34
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:46,752
<font color="#666666">Teen</font>

35
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:49,056
<font color="#fcfcfc">But what about my grades</font>

36
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:53,408
<font color="#fafafa">We're in the same AP classes right</font>

37
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:58,016
<font color="#d4d4d4">Why don't we get together after practice every day in study</font>

38
00:01:58,272 --> 00:02:02,368
<font color="#d5d5d5">I could invite a couple other members of the team to join our study group</font>

39
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,464
<font color="#dbdbdb">Make it good grades so we could help each other</font>

40
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:08,512
<font color="#fcfcfc">That just might work</font>

41
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:11,840
<font color="#fcfcfc">What do you say to having our first meeting tomorrow</font>

42
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:13,888
<font color="#fcfcfc">It sounds perfect</font>

43
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:16,960
<font color="#fafafa">I'll talk to Jenny and Karen later tonight</font>

44
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:20,544
<font color="#f5f5f5">Now answer the questions</font>

45
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:24,896
<font color="#e8e8e8">Number 10 what are the students mainly talking about</font>
