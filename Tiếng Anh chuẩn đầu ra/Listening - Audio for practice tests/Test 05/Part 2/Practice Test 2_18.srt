00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:02,048
<font color="#efefef">Questions 18 through 22</font>

2
00:00:02,816 --> 00:00:05,888
<font color="#fcfcfc">Listen to a conversation between a student and a teacher</font>

3
00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:09,728
<font color="#f6f6f6">Thanks for explaining that problem to me mrs. Peters</font>

4
00:00:09,984 --> 00:00:13,056
<font color="#fcfcfc">I think I understand the material a lot better now</font>

5
00:00:13,312 --> 00:00:16,896
<font color="#b2b2b2">It's my pleasure James I'm glad I could help you out</font>

6
00:00:17,408 --> 00:00:21,248
<font color="#e1e1e1">Anyway I guess I should leave I have PE class now</font>

7
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:22,784
<font color="#fcfcfc">Oh James</font>

8
00:00:23,296 --> 00:00:27,136
<font color="#fcfcfc">Hold on a minute there's something I've been meaning to ask you</font>

9
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:28,672
<font color="#fcfcfc">What's that</font>

10
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:35,072
<font color="#d8d8d8">In the past three weeks or so you've started speaking up in class you were so quiet last year</font>

11
00:00:35,328 --> 00:00:40,448
<font color="#f0f0f0">And in the first month of the semester but now you are contributing a lot during class</font>

12
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:41,984
<font color="#dddddd">Right</font>

13
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,360
<font color="#fcfcfc">Well I'm curious what sparked this change</font>

14
00:00:48,896 --> 00:00:52,736
<font color="#fcfcfc">I guess I have more confidence now I mean</font>

15
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:58,624
<font color="#dadada">My grades have been improving in all of my classes this semester since I started studying everyday</font>

16
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:02,720
<font color="#f5f5f5">So I guess I know more answers than I used to</font>

17
00:01:03,232 --> 00:01:04,000
<font color="#d4d4d4">Right</font>

18
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:07,328
<font color="#fcfcfc">In the past I kept quiet because I</font>

19
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,632
<font color="#fcfcfc">To be honest</font>

20
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:13,472
<font color="#f9f9f9">I never knew the answers to any of the teachers questions</font>

21
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:17,312
<font color="#f3f3f3">And I didn't really understand the material either</font>

22
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:21,664
<font color="#fcfcfc">Now that I'm trying harder I find that I can answer the questions</font>

23
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,688
<font color="#eeeeee">So</font>

24
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:27,552
<font color="#e8e8e8">I suppose I just want to show that I know the answers</font>

25
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:34,208
<font color="#e2e2e2">Good for you James I must say that I and several of your other instructors and Varian</font>

26
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:36,768
<font color="#fcfcfc">Impressed with how you've changed recently</font>

27
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:43,168
<font color="#fcfcfc">Be sure to keep up the good work and talk as much as you want in my class I love it when students</font>

28
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:44,192
<font color="#d1d1d1">Your answers</font>

29
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:50,848
<font color="#fcfcfc">Thanks for the vote of confidence I was actually a little worried that you thought I was speaking</font>

30
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:51,872
<font color="#fcfcfc">Too much</font>

31
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:58,272
<font color="#fcfcfc">Not at all I wish I could get most of the other students to speak half as much as you in class</font>

32
00:01:58,528 --> 00:02:01,088
<font color="#e0e0e0">It would make for lively discussions</font>

33
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,416
<font color="#fcfcfc">Now answer the questions</font>

34
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,464
<font color="#f8f8f8">Number 18</font>

35
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:09,024
<font color="#ececec">What are the speakers mainly talking about</font>
