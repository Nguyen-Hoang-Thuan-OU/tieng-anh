<font color="#fcfcfc">That's too bad for you but I understand them as well</font>

23
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:17,824
<font color="#fcfcfc">As a matter of fact I think I'm going to have to find a part-time job myself</font>

24
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:19,616
<font color="#fcfcfc">Find a job</font>

00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:43,168
<font color="#f9f9f9">That's why I'm thinking of getting another job</font>

32
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:45,984
<font color="#b1b1b1">There are only a few weeks left in the semester</font>

33
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:50,080
<font color="#f7f7f7">So I don't think that working now will harm my grades too badly</font>
