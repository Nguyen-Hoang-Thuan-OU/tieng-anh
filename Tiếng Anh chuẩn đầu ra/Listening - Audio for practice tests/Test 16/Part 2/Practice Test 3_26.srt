00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:02,304
<font color="#fcfcfc">Questions 26 through 29</font>

2
00:00:02,816 --> 00:00:06,144
<font color="#f8f8f8">Listen to part of the discussion in a science class</font>

3
00:00:07,168 --> 00:00:13,312
<font color="#fcfcfc">We get most of our energy from fossil fuels such as coal oil and natural gas</font>

4
00:00:13,824 --> 00:00:19,968
<font color="#f4f4f4">We'll use these fossil fuels to run machines to operate Cars airplanes and other vehicles</font>

5
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,296
<font color="#f3f3f3">To heat our homes and to make electricity</font>

6
00:00:23,552 --> 00:00:24,832
<font color="#fcfcfc">Unfortunately</font>

7
00:00:25,088 --> 00:00:27,136
<font color="#fcfcfc">Fossil fuels won't last forever</font>

8
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:29,440
<font color="#fcfcfc">Once we use them they're gone</font>

9
00:00:29,952 --> 00:00:33,792
<font color="#f8f8f8">No one is really sure how big our supply of fossil fuels is</font>

10
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:37,120
<font color="#fcfcfc">We may have enough to last for a few decades</font>

11
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:41,216
<font color="#fcfcfc">Or we might have a supply that will last for several centuries</font>

12
00:00:41,984 --> 00:00:45,312
<font color="#f6f6f6">Anyway since they are non-renewable resources</font>

13
00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:47,616
<font color="#fcfcfc">We need to use them sparingly</font>

14
00:00:47,872 --> 00:00:50,944
<font color="#fcfcfc">We also need to come up with ways to save energy</font>

15
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,760
<font color="#fcfcfc">So that we can make our supplies last longer</font>

16
00:00:54,272 --> 00:00:56,064
<font color="#fcfcfc">So any ideas</font>

17
00:00:56,832 --> 00:01:00,672
<font color="#fcfcfc">I think the best way to save energy is not to use it</font>

18
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:06,048
<font color="#f9f9f9">You're going to have to explain that a little more clearly Stephanie</font>

19
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:09,632
<font color="#fcfcfc">Are you suggesting that we not use any energy at all</font>

20
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:11,936
<font color="#fcfcfc">No I'm not</font>

21
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:15,008
<font color="#fcfcfc">I think I stated my idea poorly</font>

22
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:18,592
<font color="#fcfcfc">I mean that we can do things like walk or ride bikes</font>

23
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:20,640
<font color="#fcfcfc">Instead of driving cars</font>

24
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:24,224
<font color="#f2f2f2">By acting that way we can save gas</font>

25
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,272
<font color="#f7f7f7">Yes that makes sense</font>

26
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:27,040
<font color="#e7e7e7">Chris</font>

27
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:29,600
<font color="#e6e6e6">Since it gets pretty cold here in winter</font>

28
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:32,672
<font color="#efefef">We use lots of energy to heat our homes then</font>

29
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:33,952
<font color="#cecece">But</font>

30
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:36,512
<font color="#f7f7f7">If more people use wood to heat their homes</font>

31
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:38,560
<font color="#fcfcfc">Then we could save electricity</font>

32
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:42,656
<font color="#fcfcfc">My family always has a fire going in the fireplace during winter</font>

33
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:44,704
<font color="#fcfcfc">It keeps our home warm</font>

34
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,752
<font color="#fcfcfc">And doesn't waste any electricity</font>

35
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:49,824
<font color="#f6f6f6">That's one possible solution Chris</font>

36
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,616
<font color="#fcfcfc">But think about this</font>

37
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:55,200
<font color="#fcfcfc">Imagine how many people there are in our city</font>

38
00:01:55,456 --> 00:02:00,064
<font color="#dbdbdb">Now what would happen if all of them started burning wood during winter</font>

39
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:01,344
<font color="#d5d5d5">Yeah</font>

40
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,928
<font color="#f5f5f5">Pretty soon there wouldn't be any trees left for miles</font>

41
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:08,000
<font color="#bfbfbf">C-Class this is a problem we face</font>

42
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:14,656
<font color="#fafafa">We try to solve one problem but the solutions we come up with can often lead to other ones</font>

43
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:19,520
<font color="#fcfcfc">Well one option is to use more alternative energy sources</font>

44
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:24,896
<font color="#f9f9f9">These include solar wind water geothermal and nuclear power</font>

45
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:25,920
<font color="#fcfcfc">However</font>

46
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:29,504
<font color="#fafafa">Each of these types of energy has its own problems</font>

47
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,064
<font color="#f5f5f5">Let's focus on solar power first</font>

48
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:35,392
<font color="#fcfcfc">What are its benefits and what are its eggs</font>

49
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:36,928
<font color="#d9d9d9">Eric your hand is up</font>

50
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:40,768
<font color="#e0e0e0">Now answer the questions</font>

51
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:43,328
<font color="#fcfcfc">Number 26</font>

52
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:46,144
<font color="#fbfbfb">What is the main topic of the discussion</font>
