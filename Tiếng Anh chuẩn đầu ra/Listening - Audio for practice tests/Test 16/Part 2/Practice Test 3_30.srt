<font color="#bfbfbf">Questions 30 through 32</font>

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:05,888
<font color="#fafafa">Listen to part of a talk in a social studies class</font>

3
00:00:06,912 --> 00:00:09,984
<font color="#fcfcfc">I'm sure most of you can tell me what a desert is</font>

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,336
<font color="#fcfcfc">It's a really hot place that gets a small amount of water each year</font>

5
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:15,872
<font color="#fcfcfc">That's right isn't it</font>

6
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:17,152
<font color="#fcfcfc">Okay</font>

7
00:00:17,408 --> 00:00:18,944
<font color="#fcfcfc">I see lots of heads nodding</font>

8
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,992
<font color="#fcfcfc">But let me tell you something</font>

9
00:00:22,528 --> 00:00:25,600
<font color="#fcfcfc">That definition I just gave you is wrong</font>

10
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:29,952
<font color="#fcfcfc">Let me give you the correct definition of a desert right now</font>

11
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:34,560
<font color="#fcfcfc">It's a place that receives very little precipitation each year</font>

12
00:00:35,072 --> 00:00:36,608
<font color="#f1f1f1">Notice what I left off</font>

13
00:00:36,864 --> 00:00:38,656
<font color="#d9d9d9">I omitted the hot part</font>

14
00:00:39,168 --> 00:00:43,520
<font color="#fcfcfc">You see the reason is that there are two main types of deserts</font>

15
00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:45,824
<font color="#fafafa">Hot deserts and cold deserts</font>

16
00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:50,176
<font color="#fcfcfc">Hot deserts are the ones that most people normally think about</font>

17
00:00:50,432 --> 00:00:54,528
<font color="#fcfcfc">They are for example the Sahara Desert and the Arabian Desert</font>

18
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:59,904
<font color="#dfdfdf">The temperatures they're frequently get to be more than 40 degrees Celsius</font>

19
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,976
<font color="#fafafa">There are however cold deserts as well</font>

20
00:01:03,232 --> 00:01:07,072
<font color="#fcfcfc">The Gobi desert in Mongolia and China is one example</font>

21
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:08,608
<font color="#fcfcfc">So is Antarctica</font>

22
00:01:08,864 --> 00:01:15,008
<font color="#f7f7f7">Yes that's right despite the cold weather in Antarctica there is very little snowfall on</font>

23
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:16,288
<font color="#fcfcfc">Most of the continent</font>

24
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:21,664
<font color="#d4d4d4">We can also classify deserts according to how much rainfall they received</font>

25
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,968
<font color="#fcfcfc">We call them extremely arid</font>

26
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:26,528
<font color="#fcfcfc">Arid and semi-arid desert</font>

27
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,392
<font color="#d8d8d8">Arid as I am sure you can guess by now means dry</font>

28
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:36,512
<font color="#dadada">Extremely arid deserts received virtually no rainfall each year</font>

29
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:40,096
<font color="#f5f5f5">The Atacama Desert of Chile is one of these</font>

30
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:45,472
<font color="#f9f9f9">In some parts of that desert it hasn't rained in more than 400 years</font>

31
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:47,008
<font color="#f6f6f6">Incredible Hulk</font>

32
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:53,664
<font color="#e8e8e8">As for arid deserts they receive fewer than 250 mm of rainfall each year</font>

33
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:57,760
<font color="#f9f9f9">Most of the world's deserts fall into this category</font>

34
00:01:58,272 --> 00:02:04,416
<font color="#d8d8d8">Semi-arid desert receive between 250 and 500 mm of rain</font>

35
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:05,440
<font color="#e4e4e4">People annually</font>

36
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:09,280
<font color="#fcfcfc">That's enough for short grasses and small plants to grow</font>

37
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:13,120
<font color="#fcfcfc">Now answer the questions</font>

38
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:15,168
<font color="#fcfcfc">Number 30</font>

39
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:17,472
<font color="#fafafa">What is the main topic of the talk</font>
