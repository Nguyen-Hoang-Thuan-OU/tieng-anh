00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:02,560
<font color="#fcfcfc">Questions 33 through 37</font>

2
00:00:03,072 --> 00:00:05,376
<font color="#fafafa">Listen to part of a radio broadcast</font>

3
00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:12,288
<font color="#f7f7f7">We're back from our commercial break and we're talking with gemologist Sandy Wellman</font>

4
00:00:12,544 --> 00:00:15,872
<font color="#cecece">Professor Wellman teaches geology at the local College</font>

5
00:00:16,128 --> 00:00:19,968
<font color="#fcfcfc">And she has agreed to spend some time talking to us this evening</font>

6
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,808
<font color="#f4f4f4">Before our last break we discussed the local geology</font>

7
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,392
<font color="#e1e1e1">One thing that Professor Wellman mentioned intrigue</font>

8
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:31,488
<font color="#dadada">She said there used to be volcanic activity in this area</font>

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,048
<font color="#f9f9f9">So Professor Wellman</font>

10
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:37,120
<font color="#fcfcfc">Does that mean there might be diamonds in our area</font>

11
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:41,984
<font color="#eeeeee">If there are please let me know where so I can start digging for them</font>

12
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:46,336
<font color="#fcfcfc">Peter there may well be lots of diamonds in this region</font>

13
00:00:46,592 --> 00:00:49,920
<font color="#fcfcfc">Would you like for me to explain why please go ahead</font>

14
00:00:50,176 --> 00:00:53,248
<font color="#f9f9f9">I'm sure our listeners would love to hear this thanks</font>

15
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,320
<font color="#eeeeee">You see diamonds are simply carbon</font>

16
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:58,368
<font color="#f5f5f5">They're formed deep within the Earth</font>

17
00:00:58,624 --> 00:01:02,976
<font color="#fcfcfc">Basically the combination of extreme heat and pressure under the Earth</font>

18
00:01:03,232 --> 00:01:03,744
<font color="#fcfcfc">Surface</font>

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,280
<font color="#fcfcfc">Takes a lump of carbon</font>

20
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:09,120
<font color="#cacaca">Like coal and transforms it into a diamond</font>

21
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:13,216
<font color="#fcfcfc">What's the connection between diamonds and volcanoes</font>

22
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:15,008
<font color="#fcfcfc">Well as I said</font>

23
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:17,824
<font color="#fcfcfc">Diamonds are formed deep underground</font>

24
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,640
<font color="#fcfcfc">But we often find them near the surface</font>

25
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:22,176
<font color="#f4f4f4">How does that happen</font>

26
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:24,224
<font color="#fcfcfc">Most of the time</font>

27
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,272
<font color="#fcfcfc">It happens due to volcanoes</font>

28
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:27,552
<font color="#fcfcfc">Essentially</font>

29
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:31,136
<font color="#f3f3f3">Volcanic activity forces diamonds to the surface</font>

30
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:33,696
<font color="#d9d9d9">Aura at least close to it</font>

31
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:38,048
<font color="#fcfcfc">For that reason the majority of diamonds are discovered near places</font>

32
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:41,120
<font color="#fcfcfc">That were either volcanically active in the past</font>

33
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:42,912
<font color="#fcfcfc">Or have active volcanoes</font>

34
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:48,544
<font color="#f9f9f9">And we live in an area that once had active volcanoes right that's correct</font>

35
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:51,360
<font color="#d5d5d5">But the last volcanic eruption here</font>

36
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:53,408
<font color="#fcfcfc">Happened millions of years ago</font>

37
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:56,480
<font color="#fafafa">So we don't need to worry about any eruptions at all</font>

38
00:01:56,736 --> 00:01:57,504
<font color="#fcfcfc">That's a relief</font>

39
00:01:58,016 --> 00:02:00,320
<font color="#e1e1e1">So if I understand you correctly</font>

40
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:06,208
<font color="#f2f2f2">You're saying that all I need to do is go to the site of an extinct volcano and start digging</font>

41
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,768
<font color="#f3f3f3">And then I'll be able to find some diamonds</font>

42
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,864
<font color="#ebebeb">Oh I am definitely not saying that Peter</font>

43
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,192
<font color="#dbdbdb">Well some diamonds have been found in this area</font>

44
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:19,776
<font color="#e5e5e5">It's not as simple as grabbing a shovel in digging them up</font>

45
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:22,592
<font color="#ececec">If it were I'd already be rich</font>

46
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:27,456
<font color="#fcfcfc">Let me tell you what you need to do if you really want to find some diamonds</font>

47
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:30,272
<font color="#ededed">Now answer the questions</font>

48
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:32,832
<font color="#fcfcfc">Number 33</font>

49
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:35,648
<font color="#f3f3f3">What are the speakers mainly discussing</font>
