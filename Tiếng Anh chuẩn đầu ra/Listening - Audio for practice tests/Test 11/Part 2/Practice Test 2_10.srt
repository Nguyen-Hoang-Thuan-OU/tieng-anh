5
00:00:19,712 --> 00:00:21,760
<font color="#fcfcfc">Questions 10 through 13</font>

00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,840
<font color="#fcfcfc">I heard you're interested in joining the school newspaper as a reporter</font>

10
00:00:36,352 --> 00:00:37,120
<font color="#fcfcfc">Is that true</font>

11
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:39,424
<font color="#f9f9f9">Do you want to be a member of the staff</font>

12
00:00:39,936 --> 00:00:46,080
<font color="#fcfcfc">Sure I'd love to do that my sister is a reporter for the local paper and</font>

13
00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:52,480
<font color="#bababa">She tells me all kinds of stories about her job it sounds fun so I want to try</font>

14
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:53,248
<font color="#d4d4d4">Hyatt</font>

15
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:55,808
<font color="#fcfcfc">You know I'm the editor of the paper right</font>

16
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:02,208
<font color="#dbdbdb">Yes I'm aware is that that means you have the power to give me a job doesn't it</font>

17
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:03,744
<font color="#f4f4f4">It sure does</font>

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,560
<font color="#fcfcfc">And to be honest we need some reporters</font>

19
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:09,888
<font color="#f3f3f3">Susan was a member of the staff until three days ago</font>

20
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:12,192
<font color="#d8d8d8">But she had to quit for some reason</font>

21
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:14,240
<font color="#fcfcfc">Ever since she quit</font>

22
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:16,544
<font color="#fcfcfc">I've been looking for someone to replace her</font>

23
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,848
<font color="#b3b3b3">I'd like to give it a shot</font>

24
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:24,480
<font color="#e7e7e7">Great I know you can write because I've seen your work before you have</font>

25
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:26,528
<font color="#fcfcfc">When did you do that</font>

26
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:31,904
<font color="#fbfbfb">Remember a couple of years ago when we had to do that group project in English class</font>

27
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,696
<font color="#fcfcfc">You and I were in the same group</font>

28
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:36,000
<font color="#fcfcfc">And I read the paper that you wrote</font>

29
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:39,584
<font color="#fcfcfc">Wow I can't believe you remember it</font>

30
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:42,912
<font color="#fcfcfc">It seems like that happened so long ago</font>

31
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:43,936
<font color="#fcfcfc">Anyway</font>

32
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:47,264
<font color="#fcfcfc">What do you want me to do for my first assignment</font>

33
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,104
<font color="#fcfcfc">Do you want me to interview the new social studies teacher</font>

34
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:52,128
<font color="#cecece">No</font>

35
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:55,968
<font color="#f4f4f4">Don't worry about that I've already assigned that duty to Jim</font>

36
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:56,992
<font color="#fcfcfc">Instead</font>

37
00:01:57,248 --> 00:01:59,552
<font color="#fcfcfc">I want you to cover tonight's football game</font>

38
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:03,648
<font color="#fcfcfc">It starts at 7:30 and it should last for a couple of hours</font>

39
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,720
<font color="#fcfcfc">See if you can get some interviews after the game</font>

40
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:08,512
<font color="#fcfcfc">Especially if we win</font>

41
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:12,352
<font color="#fcfcfc">No problem I look forward to doing that</font>

42
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,448
<font color="#c4c4c4">Now answer the questions</font>

43
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:18,496
<font color="#f6f6f6">Number 10</font>
