<font color="#ebebeb">Questions 34 through 37</font>

2
00:00:03,072 --> 00:00:06,400
<font color="#f6f6f6">Listen to a teacher talking in a biology class</font>

3
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:10,496
<font color="#fbfbfb">Australia has lots of unusual mammals</font>

4
00:00:10,752 --> 00:00:13,312
<font color="#8b8b8b">Such as the kangaroo and the koala</font>

5
00:00:13,568 --> 00:00:15,360
<font color="#fbfbfb">We're going to get to them in a bit</font>

6
00:00:15,616 --> 00:00:21,248
<font color="#fcfcfc">But for a couple of minutes I'd like to tell you about another unique animal that lives there</font>

7
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:23,040
<font color="#fcfcfc">It's called the dingo</font>

8
00:00:23,296 --> 00:00:26,624
<font color="#f5f5f5">The dingo is a predator that's similar to a dog</font>

9
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,952
<font color="#fcfcfc">I guess you could say it's more like a wild dog</font>

10
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:33,536
<font color="#efefef">It's believed that the dingo migrated to Australia</font>

11
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:36,352
<font color="#fafafa">From Southeast Asia thousands of years ago</font>

12
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:41,472
<font color="#fbfbfb">Since there are wild dogs similar to the dingo in some parts of Southeast Asia</font>

13
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,288
<font color="#fcfcfc">Anyway</font>

14
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:49,920
<font color="#c1c1c1">The dingo lives mainly in the interior of Australia which is called the Outback</font>

15
00:00:50,176 --> 00:00:53,504
<font color="#e6e6e6">It has short fur that's reddish brown in color</font>

16
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,344
<font color="#949494">Its Underside is more whitish in color</font>

17
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,976
<font color="#f9f9f9">The dingo has short pointed ears and a long-tailed as for its size</font>

18
00:01:03,232 --> 00:01:06,304
<font color="#d1d1d1">It averages around 30 kg in weight</font>

19
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,608
<font color="#afafaf">You can live for up to 20 years</font>

20
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:10,912
<font color="#fcfcfc">As I already mentioned</font>

21
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:13,472
<font color="#e1e1e1">The dingo is a predator in fact</font>

22
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:18,080
<font color="#f3f3f3">It's Australia's largest Predator that lives solely on land</font>

23
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:21,664
<font color="#e5e5e5">The dingo typically eat small mammals like a</font>

24
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,712
<font color="#fcfcfc">Like rabbits and rats</font>

25
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:27,808
<font color="#f8f8f8">It also eats birds and reptiles particularly lizards</font>

26
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,136
<font color="#fcfcfc">The dingo has been known to attack livestock</font>

27
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:33,184
<font color="#f5f5f5">Mainly sheep and Cattle</font>

28
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:37,024
<font color="#eaeaea">There's an ongoing battle in Australia between farmers</font>

29
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,352
<font color="#e0e0e0">Who want to kill the dingoes that attacked their livestock</font>

30
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:43,168
<font color="#efefef">And people who want to keep them alive</font>

31
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,240
<font color="#cecece">Dingos occasionally attack humans</font>

32
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:49,056
<font color="#fcfcfc">And have in a few rare cases</font>

33
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:50,848
<font color="#f2f2f2">Killed small children</font>

34
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,408
<font color="#f3f3f3">The dingo is a social animal</font>

35
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:56,480
<font color="#e5e5e5">That typically travels in packs of up to 10</font>

36
00:01:56,736 --> 00:01:59,552
<font color="#fafafa">In that way I suppose it's like the wolf</font>

37
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:02,112
<font color="#fcfcfc">Another animal related to the dog</font>

38
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,184
<font color="#e8e8e8">Female dingoes breed once a year</font>

39
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:08,512
<font color="#d4d4d4">And give birth to up to five pups at a time</font>

40
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:12,096
<font color="#ededed">The pups usually stay with their mother for up to eight months</font>

41
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:18,752
<font color="#dadada">Now let me tell you a little about how dingoes communicate with each other I think this is pretty</font>

42
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:23,360
<font color="#fcfcfc">Now answer the questions</font>

43
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:25,664
<font color="#fcfcfc">Number 34</font>

44
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:27,968
<font color="#fcfcfc">What is the purpose of the lecture</font>
