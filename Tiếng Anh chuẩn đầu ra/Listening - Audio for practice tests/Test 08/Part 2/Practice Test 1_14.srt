00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:46,080
<font color="#eeeeee">So</font>

00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:48,384
<font color="#fcfcfc">When is your next game going to be</font>

00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,200
<font color="#fcfcfc">Do you have a game this Friday or Saturday</font>

18
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:57,600
<font color="#e6e6e6">No we don't play anymore games this week however we have two games next week.</font>

25
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:24,224
<font color="#ececec">We could use some big crowds we play much better when we've got lots of people cheering for us</font>

26
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,760
<font color="#fcfcfc">Yeah that makes sense</font>
