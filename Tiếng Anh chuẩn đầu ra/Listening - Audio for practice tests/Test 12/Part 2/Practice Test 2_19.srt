00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:05,888
<font color="#f4f4f4">Questions 19 through 22 listen to a conversation between two students</font>

2
00:00:06,912 --> 00:00:13,056
<font color="#fcfcfc">Jimmy are you going to try out for the baseball team again this year yeah but</font>

3
00:00:13,312 --> 00:00:15,872
<font color="#fcfcfc">I don't think I need to try out for the team</font>

4
00:00:16,128 --> 00:00:20,480
<font color="#cacaca">Coach is already told me that I'm going to be the starting second baseman</font>

5
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:24,320
<font color="#fcfcfc">That's great congratulations thanks Kevin</font>

6
00:00:24,576 --> 00:00:28,160
<font color="#fcfcfc">So why are you curious about the team</font>

7
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:31,488
<font color="#fcfcfc">Well I've been giving some thought to trying out</font>

8
00:00:31,744 --> 00:00:33,536
<font color="#fbfbfb">I'm a pretty decent picture</font>

9
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:36,096
<font color="#fcfcfc">So I think I've got a shot at making the team</font>

10
00:00:36,864 --> 00:00:39,424
<font color="#fcfcfc">If you're any good you'll probably make it</font>

11
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,752
<font color="#ececec">Two of our best pictures graduated last year</font>

12
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:46,336
<font color="#e9e9e9">So we could definitely use a new player too</font>

13
00:00:46,592 --> 00:00:50,432
<font color="#fcfcfc">That sounds good so assuming that I make the team</font>

14
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:52,480
<font color="#fcfcfc">What is it like to be on the team</font>

15
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:58,880
<font color="#f5f5f5">It's really cool we play about 20 games a year more if we make the playoffs</font>

16
00:00:59,136 --> 00:01:02,208
<font color="#e0e0e0">4:30 home games and half a road games</font>

17
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,768
<font color="#fcfcfc">How far away are the road games</font>

18
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:09,632
<font color="#fcfcfc">I'd say most of them are within an hour's Drive of the school</font>

19
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:14,240
<font color="#f2f2f2">But there are a couple of schools White Plains and Gadsden</font>

20
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:15,264
<font color="#fcfcfc">I think</font>

21
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,568
<font color="#f1f1f1">That are about 2 hours away</font>

22
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:20,128
<font color="#f8f8f8">That's a long ride on the school bus</font>

23
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:26,784
<font color="#dedede">Huh I didn't know that yeah it's no fun riding home on the bus if you lose one of those</font>

24
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:27,552
<font color="#fcfcfc">Games</font>

25
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:29,088
<font color="#efefef">I can imagine</font>

26
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,160
<font color="#dedede">How does being on a team affect your school work Jimmy</font>

27
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:36,768
<font color="#f5f5f5">It's rather hard when you've got a test the day after an away game</font>

28
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:40,608
<font color="#f2f2f2">But I try to do my best so my grades are good</font>

29
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:47,264
<font color="#f6f6f6">I don't know if you work part-time or not but you won't be able to do that if you're on the team and want to keep</font>

30
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,288
<font color="#fcfcfc">Keep your grades up</font>

31
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:52,384
<font color="#fcfcfc">Now answer the questions</font>

32
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:54,688
<font color="#fbfbfb">Number 19</font>

33
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:57,504
<font color="#ececec">What are the speakers mainly talking about</font>
