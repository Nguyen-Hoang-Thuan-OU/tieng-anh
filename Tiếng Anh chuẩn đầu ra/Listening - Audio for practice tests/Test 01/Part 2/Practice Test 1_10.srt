<font color="#c0c0c0">No you will hear longer dogs or conversations</font>

00:00:03,328 --> 00:00:06,912
<font color="#bdbdbd">Each talk or conversation will be followed by three or more questions</font>

00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:13,056
<font color="#f3f3f3">Choose the best answer to each question and mark the letter of the correct answer on your answer sheet</font>

00:00:13,568 --> 00:00:16,896
<font color="#f9f9f9">You will hear each talk or conversation only one time</font>

5
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,968
<font color="#fcfcfc">Questions 10 through 13</font>

6
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,296
<font color="#fcfcfc">Listen to a conversation between two students</font>

7
00:00:24,064 --> 00:00:28,160
<font color="#b6b6b6">Sandy I like to congratulate you on winning the election</font>

8
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:32,256
<font color="#fbfbfb">It's so amazing you just got voted student body president</font>

9
00:00:32,768 --> 00:00:38,144
<font color="#efefef">Thanks for saying that Tom honestly I can't believe I won the election</font>

10
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:41,216
<font color="#fcfcfc">I was positive Randy was going to win</font>

11
00:00:41,472 --> 00:00:44,288
<font color="#fbfbfb">The results were a pleasant surprise for me though</font>

12
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:48,896
<font color="#fcfcfc">Yeah that's what a lot of people thought since he's so popular</font>

13
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:49,664
<font color="#cecece">But</font>

14
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,272
<font color="#fcfcfc">Apparently more people wanted you to do the job</font>

15
00:00:54,784 --> 00:00:56,320
<font color="#fcfcfc">I guess so</font>

16
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:57,344
<font color="#fcfcfc">Anyway</font>

17
00:00:58,624 --> 00:01:02,720
<font color="#f2f2f2">Now that you just got elected what are you planning to do as president</font>

18
00:01:03,232 --> 00:01:06,560
<font color="#fcfcfc">Do you have any big plans for the student body this year</font>

19
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:13,216
<font color="#fcfcfc">I sure do first of all I intend to do my best to keep every single one of my campaign</font>

20
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:14,240
<font color="#dbdbdb">Promises</font>

21
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:19,360
<font color="#fcfcfc">I'm going to start by focusing on the food selection in the cafeteria this year</font>

22
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:25,248
<font color="#fcfcfc">That would be great the quality of the food has really gone down the past few months</font>

23
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:31,136
<font color="#f8f8f8">I've been bringing my own lunch lately because I can't stand eating the food there anymore</font>

24
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:36,768
<font color="#d9d9d9">I know exactly what you're talkin about that's why I'm going to look into it</font>

25
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:39,328
<font color="#fcfcfc">That would be great good luck</font>

26
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,864
<font color="#dfdfdf">Thanks</font>

27
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:47,264
<font color="#c5c5c5">Well you're handling the cafeteria are you planning to take care of any of your other campaign promises as well</font>

28
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:50,848
<font color="#fcfcfc">I don't want to do too much at once</font>

29
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:57,248
<font color="#fcfcfc">Basically I need to get used to my new position when I'm more comfortable in a month or two</font>

30
00:01:57,504 --> 00:02:01,088
<font color="#e3e3e3">I think I'll work on fulfilling my other campaign promises</font>

31
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:04,928
<font color="#f5f5f5">No answer the questions</font>

32
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:06,720
<font color="#f6f6f6">Number 10</font>

33
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:09,280
<font color="#f5f5f5">What are the students mainly discussing</font>
