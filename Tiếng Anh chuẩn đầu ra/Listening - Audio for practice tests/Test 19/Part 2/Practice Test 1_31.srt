<font color="#fcfcfc">Questions 31 through 34</font>

2
00:00:02,304 --> 00:00:04,608
<font color="#f5f5f5">Listen to a teacher talking in a biology class</font>

3
00:00:05,888 --> 00:00:09,984
<font color="#f4f4f4">One of the strangest looking animals in the world is the anteater</font>

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,056
<font color="#f9f9f9">Take a look at this picture of it up on the screen here</font>

5
00:00:13,312 --> 00:00:18,176
<font color="#dadada">The most obvious physical feature is the long snowed or nose</font>

6
00:00:18,432 --> 00:00:22,784
<font color="#f3f3f3">The anteater uses its note to dig in the ground for ants and termites</font>

7
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,576
<font color="#eeeeee">It's two favorite foods</font>

8
00:00:25,088 --> 00:00:28,672
<font color="#dfdfdf">This animal you're looking at here is a giant anteater</font>

9
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:31,744
<font color="#f2f2f2">It can grow to almost two meters in length</font>

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,584
<font color="#f1f1f1">But a lot of that is it snowed in big bushy-tailed</font>

11
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,888
<font color="#dedede">So it's body isn't that large</font>

12
00:00:38,144 --> 00:00:44,288
<font color="#eaeaea">There are two other anteater species they are the silky anteater and the southern tamandua</font>

13
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,872
<font color="#fcfcfc">Both are a bit smaller than the giant anteater</font>

14
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:49,920
<font color="#fcfcfc">Yes Brenda your hand is up</font>

15
00:00:50,432 --> 00:00:52,992
<font color="#fcfcfc">Where does the giant anteater live</font>

16
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,088
<font color="#fcfcfc">It resides mostly in Central and South America</font>

17
00:00:57,344 --> 00:01:00,928
<font color="#e6e6e6">Its territory ranges from Mexico to Northern Brazil</font>

18
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,280
<font color="#f1f1f1">How about some of its other physical characteristics</font>

19
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:06,048
<font color="#fcfcfc">Again</font>

20
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:07,584
<font color="#efefef">Focus on the screen</font>

21
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,936
<font color="#c1c1c1">It has stiff bristle liefer that's brown or gray in color</font>

22
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:16,032
<font color="#d3d3d3">Sometimes it's for can be so dark that it's almost black</font>

23
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:18,080
<font color="#e7e7e7">Now look at this note</font>

24
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:21,408
<font color="#d4d4d4">Notice that it's both is at the very end of it</font>

25
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:22,432
<font color="#fcfcfc">Cool huh</font>

26
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,736
<font color="#eaeaea">The anteater lacks teeth</font>

27
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:29,600
<font color="#f4f4f4">But it has a very long tongue that can extend far from its most</font>

28
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:31,904
<font color="#f2f2f2">Also observe its paws</font>

29
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:35,488
<font color="#d7d7d7">Each ball has very long sharp claws</font>

30
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:40,608
<font color="#dadada">Beyond Cedar uses them to get inside an ant hill or termite Mound</font>

31
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:44,704
<font color="#c8c8c8">Then it uses its tongue to find ants and termites</font>

32
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,984
<font color="#fcfcfc">And to eat them</font>

33
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,776
<font color="#fcfcfc">In case you're curious</font>

34
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:54,176
<font color="#dbdbdb">A single anteater can consume up to 35,000 dance in one day now that's</font>

35
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:56,224
<font color="#b6b6b6">What's a big appetite</font>

36
00:01:56,736 --> 00:01:59,808
<font color="#e1e1e1">The giant anteater usually lived alone</font>

37
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,368
<font color="#fafafa">It can be territorial at times</font>

38
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:05,952
<font color="#e7e7e7">Yet as a general rule it's rather do cile</font>

39
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:09,280
<font color="#f9f9f9">Pumas and jaguars sometimes Hunted</font>

40
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:12,096
<font color="#fafafa">But it has few other natural enemies</font>

41
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:17,728
<font color="#bababa">No how about watching a short video of an anteater attacking a termite Mound</font>

42
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:20,288
<font color="#fcfcfc">I think you'll find this fascinating</font>

43
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,872
<font color="#ececec">Now answer the questions</font>

44
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:25,920
<font color="#fcfcfc">Number 31</font>

45
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:28,224
<font color="#fcfcfc">What is the teacher mainly talking about</font>
