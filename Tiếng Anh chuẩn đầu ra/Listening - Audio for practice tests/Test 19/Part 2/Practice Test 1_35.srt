<font color="#e2e2e2">Questions 35 through 38</font>

2
00:00:02,304 --> 00:00:04,864
<font color="#e9e9e9">Listen to a teacher talking and a chemistry class</font>

3
00:00:05,888 --> 00:00:07,936
<font color="#f4f4f4">It's going to be cold tonight</font>

4
00:00:08,192 --> 00:00:13,568
<font color="#fcfcfc">In fact it's going to be so cold that we're supposed to get the first Frost of the year</font>

5
00:00:13,824 --> 00:00:17,152
<font color="#b4b4b4">No I know you've all heard that word before</font>

6
00:00:17,408 --> 00:00:21,248
<font color="#fcfcfc">But what exactly does it mean what is Frost</font>

7
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:22,528
<font color="#fcfcfc">Simply put</font>

8
00:00:22,784 --> 00:00:24,832
<font color="#fcfcfc">It's a type of Frozen water</font>

9
00:00:25,088 --> 00:00:27,648
<font color="#f9f9f9">When the air has too much water vapor</font>

10
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:32,256
<font color="#fcfcfc">It condenses then it gets deposited on many surfaces</font>

11
00:00:32,512 --> 00:00:36,864
<font color="#f0f0f0">Including the including the ground plus cars and windows</font>

12
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:39,424
<font color="#fcfcfc">If the temperature is cold enough</font>

13
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:43,520
<font color="#eaeaea">The water vapor freezes and thereby forms Frost</font>

14
00:00:44,032 --> 00:00:46,848
<font color="#e7e7e7">Frost always appears to be white in color</font>

15
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:50,432
<font color="#f8f8f8">The reason is that the frost crystals contain are</font>

16
00:00:50,944 --> 00:00:52,992
<font color="#fcfcfc">There are different types of Frost</font>

17
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:55,040
<font color="#fcfcfc">Let me tell you about three of them</font>

18
00:00:55,552 --> 00:00:57,600
<font color="#f7f7f7">Hoarfrost is one that</font>

19
00:00:57,856 --> 00:01:00,160
<font color="#f7f7f7">HOA are by the way</font>

20
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:02,720
<font color="#f5f5f5">It resembles loose ice crystals</font>

21
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:06,560
<font color="#dddddd">It can form on the ground or on virtually any object</font>

22
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:10,912
<font color="#e2e2e2">It often appears in the morning and after a cold clear night</font>

23
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:16,032
<font color="#fcfcfc">It manifests when water vapor condenses on a very cold surface</font>

24
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:20,640
<font color="#fcfcfc">What happens is that the water vapor freezes on contact</font>

25
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:24,224
<font color="#dcdcdc">A second type of frost is Rime Frost</font>

26
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:27,552
<font color="#e7e7e7">Spell that rime</font>

27
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:31,392
<font color="#fcfcfc">There's a picture of it in your books on page 194</font>

28
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:32,160
<font color="#fcfcfc">Take a look</font>

29
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:36,512
<font color="#fcfcfc">Note the ice crystals that are around the flower petals</font>

30
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:43,168
<font color="#e1e1e1">It forms when icy Wind Blows and water vapor freezes on flowers plants and trees</font>

31
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:43,936
<font color="#ebebeb">Three branches</font>

32
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:45,216
<font color="#fcfcfc">Pretty isn't it</font>

33
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:50,336
<font color="#e7e7e7">I should make an important point about Frost before we continue</font>

34
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:52,640
<font color="#f9f9f9">One big problem with frost</font>

35
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:54,944
<font color="#fcfcfc">Is that it can kill plants</font>

36
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:01,344
<font color="#e4e4e4">If Farmers plant their crops too early in the spring a late Frost can cause lots of damage</font>

37
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,136
<font color="#d1d1d1">And many plants can die</font>

38
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:08,256
<font color="#f0f0f0">In Fall if there is an early Frost like tonight's expected one</font>

39
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:13,120
<font color="#fbfbfb">Farmers need to harvest their crops to keep them from suffering any damage</font>

40
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:17,472
<font color="#eaeaea">No third type of frost is Fern Frost</font>

41
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:20,288
<font color="#fcfcfc">It's sometimes called window Frost</font>

42
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:22,848
<font color="#fcfcfc">There's a picture of it in your books as well</font>

43
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:25,920
<font color="#f6f6f6">It resembles the leaves of a fern doesn't it</font>

44
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:29,504
<font color="#fafafa">This type of frost forms when you have a window pane</font>

45
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,344
<font color="#fcfcfc">It's very warm on the inside and very cold on the outside</font>

46
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:36,928
<font color="#dcdcdc">No answer the questions</font>

47
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:39,232
<font color="#fcfcfc">Number 35</font>

48
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:42,048
<font color="#efefef">What is the teacher say about hoarfrost</font>
