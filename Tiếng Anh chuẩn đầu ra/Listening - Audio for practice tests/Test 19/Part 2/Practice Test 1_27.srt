<font color="#c4c4c4">Question 27 through 30</font>

2
00:00:02,304 --> 00:00:04,864
<font color="#cdcdcd">Listen to a teacher talking in a history class</font>

3
00:00:05,888 --> 00:00:11,008
<font color="#ececec">People often talk about one major event in human history that led to civilization</font>

4
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,824
<font color="#bababa">You talkin about the discovery of agriculture</font>

5
00:00:14,592 --> 00:00:20,736
<font color="#e4e4e4">Once humans learned how to farm they were able to settle down Bill Villages and towns and basically</font>

6
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:22,272
<font color="#cccccc">Great civilizations</font>

7
00:00:22,528 --> 00:00:25,344
<font color="#dddddd">But there's another event that help humans considerably</font>

8
00:00:25,856 --> 00:00:27,392
<font color="#fcfcfc">Does anyone have a guess</font>

9
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:29,440
<font color="#fcfcfc">Learning how to write</font>

10
00:00:29,952 --> 00:00:34,048
<font color="#fcfcfc">Well yes that was important but it's not what I'm thinking about</font>

11
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:36,864
<font color="#fcfcfc">I'm talking about the domestication of animals</font>

12
00:00:37,376 --> 00:00:39,936
<font color="#fcfcfc">There are huge numbers of animals on the planet</font>

13
00:00:40,192 --> 00:00:45,568
<font color="#e4e4e4">But throughout all human history only a relative handful of them have been domesticated</font>

14
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:50,944
<font color="#fcfcfc">People have tried domesticating many animals but it's just not possible in most cases</font>

15
00:00:51,712 --> 00:00:55,808
<font color="#fcfcfc">It's likely that the first animal which humans domesticated was the dog</font>

16
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:58,112
<font color="#fcfcfc">No one knows for sure when this happened</font>

17
00:00:58,624 --> 00:01:00,928
<font color="#fcfcfc">But we can make an educated guess</font>

18
00:01:01,184 --> 00:01:05,024
<font color="#d5d5d5">DNA testing tells us the dogs and wolves are related</font>

19
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:06,816
<font color="#f1f1f1">Sometime in the past</font>

20
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:09,632
<font color="#fcfcfc">They separated into two distinct species</font>

21
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:13,728
<font color="#d8d8d8">It probably happened around do 100,000 years ago</font>

22
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:19,616
<font color="#dddddd">Some experts believe it occurred in East Asia While others claim it took place in the Middle East</font>

23
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:21,408
<font color="#fcfcfc">We don't know for sure though</font>

24
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:25,504
<font color="#f5f5f5">How did dogs and humans come to have such a close relationship</font>

25
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:30,624
<font color="#fcfcfc">The most popular Theory claims that they provided mutual benefits for one another</font>

26
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:33,440
<font color="#e6e6e6">Dogs protecting humans from animals</font>

27
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:34,720
<font color="#fcfcfc">And other humans</font>

28
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:36,512
<font color="#e0e0e0">They also help people hunt</font>

29
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:40,608
<font color="#f0f0f0">In return humans provided dogs with steady supplies of food</font>

30
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:44,192
<font color="#dddddd">They also gave dogs relatively safe places to live</font>

31
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:48,288
<font color="#d4d4d4">Overtime the two developed an extremely close relationship</font>

32
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:51,616
<font color="#ececec">Do we know when the first dog was Tamed</font>

33
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:58,272
<font color="#f5f5f5">No but again we can make an educated guess there's a site in Germany where human and dogs</font>

34
00:01:58,528 --> 00:02:00,320
<font color="#fcfcfc">Skeletons were found buried together</font>

35
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:04,416
<font color="#ededed">Those bones date back to around 14,000 years ago</font>

36
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:10,048
<font color="#c1c1c1">A similar sighting China has bones that date to 7500 years ago</font>

37
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:16,704
<font color="#eaeaea">At a dig site in Siberia that's around 6200 years old dog was found buried next</font>

38
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,496
<font color="#d6d6d6">Too many humans in a cemetery</font>

39
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:23,616
<font color="#e1e1e1">All three of those fine show how highly regarded dogs were in their communities</font>

40
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:28,992
<font color="#f1f1f1">So we can infer that dogs have been domesticated in those places due to where they were buried</font>

41
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:32,576
<font color="#dedede">No answer the questions</font>

42
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:34,368
<font color="#fcfcfc">Number 27</font>

43
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:37,184
<font color="#f8f8f8">What is the teacher mainly discussing</font>
