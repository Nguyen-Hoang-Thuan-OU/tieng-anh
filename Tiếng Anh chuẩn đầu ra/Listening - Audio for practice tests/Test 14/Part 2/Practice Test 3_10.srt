00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:06,400
<font color="#ebebeb">Now you will hear longer talks or conversations each talk or conversation will be followed by</font>

2
00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:07,936
<font color="#fcfcfc">Three or more questions</font>

3
00:00:08,192 --> 00:00:14,336
<font color="#fcfcfc">Choose the best answer to each question and mark the letter of the correct answer on your answer sheet</font>

4
00:00:14,592 --> 00:00:18,688
<font color="#fafafa">You will hear each talk or conversation only one time</font>

5
00:00:19,712 --> 00:00:25,600
<font color="#f5f5f5">Questions 10 through 13 listen to a conversation between a student and a teacher</font>

6
00:00:26,624 --> 00:00:30,720
<font color="#f1f1f1">Mary why don't you stay here for a moment I need to chat with you about something</font>

7
00:00:31,232 --> 00:00:33,280
<font color="#f1f1f1">Sure thing mr. Kimball</font>

8
00:00:33,536 --> 00:00:37,376
<font color="#eeeeee">I'm curious I asked a question in class that nobody could answer</font>

9
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:38,400
<font color="#fcfcfc">Remember that</font>

10
00:00:38,656 --> 00:00:41,984
<font color="#fbfbfb">Yes sir I do well nobody answered</font>

11
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,032
<font color="#fcfcfc">But I'm pretty sure that you could have</font>

12
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:46,080
<font color="#fcfcfc">I'm a good judge of students</font>

13
00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:47,104
<font color="#e0e0e0">After all</font>

14
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:52,992
<font color="#bfbfbf">I've been teaching for more than two decades that I could tell by the look in your eyes that you knew the answer</font>

15
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:58,368
<font color="#f9f9f9">I'm right aren't I yes you are I knew the answer</font>

16
00:00:58,624 --> 00:01:01,184
<font color="#f7f7f7">So why didn't you speak up and say anything</font>

17
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,536
<font color="#fafafa">I don't really enjoy speaking in front of others</font>

18
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:12,192
<font color="#fcfcfc">I'm a little shy I am I get kind of nervous if I have to talk in class</font>

19
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:13,472
<font color="#797979">IC</font>

20
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:19,872
<font color="#f7f7f7">In that case would it help if I called on you I mean instead of raising your hand and volunteering an answer</font>

21
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:22,176
<font color="#e4e4e4">How about if I just asked you directly</font>

22
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:24,224
<font color="#fcfcfc">Do you think that would be better</font>

23
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:29,856
<font color="#fcfcfc">It might I can't say for sure I just have a hard time speaking up</font>

24
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:35,232
<font color="#e3e3e3">Okay let's try it the next time we have class if it makes you feel uncomfortable</font>

25
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:36,768
<font color="#fcfcfc">I won't do it anymore</font>

26
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:40,864
<font color="#fcfcfc">But I'd like to see you speak more since I know you have a lot to contribute</font>

27
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,424
<font color="#bfbfbf">We'll get my idea shot</font>

28
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:46,752
<font color="#cdcdcd">Thanks mr. Kimball I appreciate that</font>

29
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:50,592
<font color="#fcfcfc">Now answer the questions</font>

30
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:52,640
<font color="#f6f6f6">Number 10</font>

31
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:55,456
<font color="#efefef">What are the speakers mainly discussing</font>
