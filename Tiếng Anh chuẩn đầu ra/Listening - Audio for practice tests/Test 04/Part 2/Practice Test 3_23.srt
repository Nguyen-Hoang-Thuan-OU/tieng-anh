<font color="#ececec">Questions 23 through 26</font>

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:05,120
<font color="#fcfcfc">Listen to a conversation between two students</font>

3
00:00:06,144 --> 00:00:09,984
<font color="#e8e8e8">George have you figured out your schedule for next semester yet</font>

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,800
<font color="#cccccc">There's not too much just think about is there</font>

5
00:00:13,056 --> 00:00:14,848
<font color="#fcfcfc">What do you mean by that</font>

6
00:00:15,104 --> 00:00:18,944
<font color="#fcfcfc">I mean that we don't even have a choice for several of our classes</font>

7
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:24,064
<font color="#c9c9c9">Let's see we're required to take English we have to take History 2</font>

8
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,880
<font color="#f5f5f5">And we have to enroll in PE as well</font>

9
00:00:27,136 --> 00:00:30,976
<font color="#fcfcfc">Oh yeah I see your point but what about math</font>

10
00:00:31,232 --> 00:00:32,256
<font color="#fcfcfc">What about it</font>

11
00:00:32,512 --> 00:00:34,304
<font color="#fcfcfc">I'm taking geometry next year</font>

12
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:37,120
<font color="#f4f4f4">That's what you're going to be taking as well isn't it</font>

13
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:38,656
<font color="#fcfcfc">That's right</font>

14
00:00:38,912 --> 00:00:41,728
<font color="#f3f3f3">And I'm taking Spanish 3 next semester</font>

15
00:00:41,984 --> 00:00:47,872
<font color="#f3f3f3">Not me so I guess our schedules will be different there I'm taking French 3 instead</font>

16
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:52,480
<font color="#fcfcfc">I wish I had taken Spanish but it's too late for me to change now</font>

17
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:55,808
<font color="#fcfcfc">Are you going to take biology or physics</font>

18
00:00:56,064 --> 00:01:02,208
<font color="#ececec">Definitely physics I don't enjoy biology plus I love math and physics has a good deal of me</font>

19
00:01:02,464 --> 00:01:02,976
<font color="#efefef">Math unit</font>

20
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:07,072
<font color="#fafafa">That's the same reason I'm going to take physics as well</font>

21
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:10,656
<font color="#f1f1f1">So there really isn't that much for us to decide on is there</font>

22
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:13,984
<font color="#fcfcfc">Wait we have to take one more class</font>

23
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:19,104
<font color="#fcfcfc">We can choose from art music computer science and economics</font>

24
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:23,456
<font color="#fcfcfc">I can't make up my mind between music and economics</font>

25
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:29,856
<font color="#e1e1e1">I'm leaning toward economics but I really enjoyed taking classes with Ms Jenkins the music teacher</font>

26
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:32,416
<font color="#f6f6f6">She is a lot of fun isn't she</font>

27
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:36,512
<font color="#fcfcfc">But as for me I'm going to sign up for the computer science class</font>

28
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:39,840
<font color="#fcfcfc">That's what I'm hoping to major in when I go to college</font>

29
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:43,424
<font color="#dcdcdc">No answer the questions</font>

30
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:45,472
<font color="#fcfcfc">Number 23</font>

31
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:48,032
<font color="#f6f6f6">What are the students mainly discussing</font>
