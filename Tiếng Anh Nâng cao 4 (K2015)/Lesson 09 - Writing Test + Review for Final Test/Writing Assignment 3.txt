I want to go back to my hometown to live after graduating from university city, my hometown in Gia Lai. Because I get to live with my family, I can easily take care of my family.

Air in Gia Lai so fresh, view around in the countryside is mainly mountainous , therefore in the winter the temperature drops to 16 degrees Celsius. In the rush hours traffic countryside no traffic jams. Neighbors are all very interested in each other, everyone is friendly and approachable, when you have a problem, everyone is very happy to help.

It's not as busy in the countryside as it is in the city, and it's harder to get a job than in the city, but I can get more job from freelancer.

I love family, therefore living with family is a great choice, and Gia Lai a place worth living.
