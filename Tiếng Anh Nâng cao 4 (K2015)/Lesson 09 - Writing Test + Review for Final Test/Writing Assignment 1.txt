Your college is going to close the student cafeteria.

Dear Madam,

We are writing to express our shock at the news that the student cafeteria is going to close. 

You know that the classes begin at 7.am in our school, so it is too difficult for us to complete everything even have breakfast before going to school, especially students renting rooms far from school. Therefore, I think the student cafeteria is the best place for us when we have break time and a suitable one to gossip with our friends without inhibition after the classes. 

In addition, the student cafeteria helps us save our time and keep safe instead of going out of campus to buy food in the rush hours. Furthermore, we have a fondness for playful and adorable cats in the cafeteria, for we cannot imagine how sad we will be when we can’t see anymore.

We hope you can keep the student cafeteria but reduce the hours of operation from 12 hours to 8 hours instead of closing it. Please consider this matter.

We look forward to hearing from you soon.

Yours sincerely,

Nguyen Nguyet Phuong Bao

The K18CNTT Representative of Open University
